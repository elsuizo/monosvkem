**Monosvkem** trades the all too common angry fruit salad for the subtle hues
of the goopy mess stuck at the bottom of the cement mixer.

It only cares about `control flow`, `strings`, things that get linked to the
`special` group - more often than not escape codes and string formatting
parameters - and, if you really want it to, `function definitions`.

It used to be a dirty hack of
[Iosvkem](https://www.github.com/neutaaaaan/iosvkem) but it has since been
rewritten from scratch to support both dark and light backgrounds.  
Ansi colours are not supported. Ansi colours will not be supported.  
We're in 2019.
