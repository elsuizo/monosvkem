### Mostly abandoned, will check pull requests but am unlikely to work on Monosvkem on my own in the future.

**Monosvkem** is an ugly hack of [Iosvkem](https://github.com/neutaaaaan/iosvkem)
I came up with one night, thinking I liked the various acme/mostly monochrome
themes floating around, but didn't *like* **like** them.  
It only highlights `strings`, things that get slammed in the `special` group, 
and, optionally, `function definitions`.

Being an ugly hack of Iosvkem, it relies on our lord and saviour [lifepillar](https://github.com/lifepillar/)'s 
[Colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate) plugin and 
supports both true colours and 256 colours terminal emulators.

- The ui shouldn't be any more broken than Iosvkem's but your never know so
keep an eye out for weird stuff.

- There's a toggle for function definitions. Right now, it barely ever does 
anything. I need help, and not just of the medical kind. You'll find more about
this in `doc/options.md`.
