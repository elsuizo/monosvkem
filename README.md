**Monosvkem** trades the all too common angry fruit salad for the subtle hues
of the goopy mess stuck at the bottom of the cement mixer.

Monosvkem only bothers itself with `control flow`, `strings`and things that get
linked to the`special` group.

It used to be a dirty hack of

rewritten from scratch to support both dark and light backgrounds.  
Ansi colours are not supported. Ansi colours will not be supported.
